# Short Read Alignment

## Niket Patel

## Methods
This project will explore various splice-aware short-read alginers as described by Martin and Wang [1]. The aligners are Blat, TopHat, GSNAP, SpliceMap,
and MapSplice. Because we are comparing aligners, a reference-based strategy will be taken towards transcriptome assembly.
